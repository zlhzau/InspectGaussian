# InspectGaussian
InspectGaussian is a comprehensive framework designed for the reconstruction and detection of large-scale orchards (e.g., citrus orchards). The framework integrates pose estimation, single-plant view extraction, and an improved 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) technique to achieve high-precision 3D reconstruction and analysis of orchard environments.
